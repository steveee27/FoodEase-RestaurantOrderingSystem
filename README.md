## Project Description

**FoodEase** was created to address several challenges faced by restaurants, particularly in improving customer experience and operational efficiency. Many restaurants still rely on manual, face-to-face ordering, which can be slow and inefficient, especially during peak times. With the integration of a digital food ordering system, FoodEase aims to simplify the ordering process, reduce wait times, and improve the quality of service. The app also includes AI-powered chat assistance to provide personalized recommendations to customers, enhancing their dining experience.

## Features

- **View Menu**: Customers can easily explore the menu with detailed descriptions, prices, and images.
- **Search Menu**: Quickly find dishes based on keywords.
- **Add to Cart & Edit Cart**: Customers can manage their orders before checkout.
- **Checkout**: Fast and efficient payment process.
- **AI Chat Assistance**: Provides real-time, interactive recommendations and answers to customer inquiries.
